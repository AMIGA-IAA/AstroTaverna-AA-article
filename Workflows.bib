	Abstract = {Abstract Heliophysics is the study of highly energetic events that originate on the Sun and propagate through the solar system. Such events can cause critical and possibly fatal disruption of the electromagnetic systems on spacecraft and on ground-based structures such as electric power grids, so there is a clear need to understand the events in their totality as they propagate through space and time. The e-Science challenge posed is that the data was gathered by many observatories and communities that have hitherto not needed to work together. Firstly, this involves the problem of helping users to more easily find and understand the relevance of data, especially data from outside their domain. Secondly, it involves solving challenges of data integration. We describe the design of the \{HELIO\} infrastructure, based on the use of Web services linked together by workflows and accessible via portal-based user interfaces. We also discuss current progress in the implementation of this infrastructure and the feedback from the user community.},

	Abstract = {The Taverna workflow tool suite (http://www.taverna.org.uk) is designed to combine distributed Web Services and/or local tools into complex analysis pipelines. These pipelines can be executed on local desktop machines or through larger infrastructure (such as supercomputers, Grids or cloud environments), using the Taverna Server. In bioinformatics, Taverna workflows are typically used in the areas of high-throughput omics analyses (for example, proteomics or transcriptomics), or for evidence gathering methods involving text mining or data mining. Through Taverna, scientists have access to several thousand different tools and resources that are freely available from a large range of life science institutions. Once constructed, the workflows are reusable, executable bioinformatics protocols that can be shared, reused and repurposed. A repository of public workflows is available at http://www.myexperiment.org. This article provides an update to the Taverna tool suite, highlighting new features and developments in the workbench and the Taverna Server.},

	Abstract = {A metaphor of Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) can be leveraged not only to make the process of creation and editing of scientific workflows easier, but to execute, monitor, and troubleshoot workflows. By using ELN as a metaphor for Scientific Workflow Management System (SWFMS), scientific users can have the familiar user interface it offers with the benefits of SWFMS, such as the ability to automate recording provenance of scientific experiments and to facilitate reproducing of scientific results. Furthermore, Web 2.0 can enhance ELN to make it easier to collaborate and share scientific content by using emerging Web standards. Cloud and Grid environments require that workflows be fault-tolerant and can adapt to changes. ELN, as an underlying storage model for SFWMS, allows necessary flexibility in adapting running workflows both automatically and by users editing ELN to change their workflows.},

	Abstract = {Data volumes from multiple sky surveys have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into tens (or hundreds) of petabytes in the next decade. This exponential growth of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new approaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an informal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned to e- Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and therefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in astronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the maximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys, facilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science specialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and support of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics. Astroinformatics includes a set of naturally-
related specialties including data organization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies, astronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization, and astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy now needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within agency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate training, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of Astroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The future of astronomy depends on it.},

This simple consideration is behind the international efforts to build virtual organizations such as, for instance, the Virtual Observatory (VObs). DAME (DAta Mining \& Exploration) is an innovative, general purpose, Web-based, VObs compliant, distributed data mining infrastructure specialized in Massive Data Sets exploration with machine learning methods. Initially fine tuned to deal with astronomical data only, DAME has evolved in a general purpose platform which has found applications also in other domains of human endeavor. We present the products and a short outline of a science case, together with a detailed description of DAMEs main features and architecture.},

Since the advent of new technologies, the interoperability between the data and service providers has become a priority because it allows an easy access and sharing of various data (catalogues, images, spectrum ...) and it leads to the concept of Virtual Observatory. The astronomer will in a near future have new ``virtual'' instruments useful for his research through simple Web interfaces or user friendly tools. Collaborations are essential in order to lead to the consensuses and the bases necessary for its construction. National (OV France, U.S. NVO\ldots) and transnational (ESA, ESO) projects have joined together within the International Virtual Observatory Alliance to take part in the development of Recommendations in various fields (Data Model, Data Access Layer, Semantics, Grid, etc.) through biannual dedicated conferences.},

	Abstract = {Efficient data management is a key component in achieving good performance for scientific workflows in distributed environments. Workflow applications typically communicate data between tasks using files. When tasks are distributed, these files are either transferred from one computational node to another, or accessed through a shared storage system. In grids and clusters, workflow data is often stored on network and parallel file systems. In this paper we investigate some of the ways in which data can be managed for workflows in the cloud. We ran experiments using three typical workflow applications on Amazon's EC2. We discuss the various storage and file systems we used, describe the issues and problems we encountered deploying them on EC2, and analyze the resulting performance and cost of the workflows.},

The rich and diverse information content within this "virtual sky" and the array of results to be derived therefrom will far exceed the current capacity of data search and research tools. The new digital surveys have the potential of facilitating a wide range of scientific discoveries about the Universe! To enable this to happen, the astronomical community is embarking on an ambitious endeavor, the creation of a National Virtual Observatory (NVO). This will in fact develop into a Global Virtual Observatory. To facilitate the new type of science enabled by the NVO, new techniques in data mining and knowledge discovery in large databases must be developed and deployed, and the next generation of astronomers must be trained in these techniques. This activity will benefit greatly from developments in the fields of information technology, computer science, and statistics. 
Aspects of the NVO initiative, including sample science user scenarios and user requirements will be presented. The value of scientific data mining and some early test case results will be discussed in the context of the speaker's research interests in colliding and merging galaxies.},

	Abstract = {myExperiment (http://www.myexperiment.org) is an online research environment that supports the social sharing of bioinformatics workflows. These workflows are procedures consisting of a series of computational tasks using web services, which may be performed on data from its retrieval, integration and analysis, to the visualization of the results. As a public repository of workflows, myExperiment allows anybody to discover those that are relevant to their research, which can then be reused and repurposed to their specific requirements. Conversely, developers can submit their workflows to myExperiment and enable them to be shared in a secure manner. Since its release in 2007, myExperiment currently has over 3500 registered users and contains more than 1000 workflows. The social aspect to the sharing of these workflows is facilitated by registered users forming virtual communities bound together by a common interest or research project. Contributors of work- flows can build their reputation within 
these communities by receiving feedback and credit from individuals who reuse their work. Further docu- mentation about myExperiment including its REST web service is available from http://wiki.myexp eriment.org. Feedback and requests for support can be sent to bugs@myexperiment.org.},

	Abstract = {In the coming era of data-intensive science, it will be increasingly important to be able to seamlessly move between scientific results, the data analyzed in them, and the processes used to produce them. As observations, derived data products, publications, and object metadata are curated by different projects and archived in different locations, establishing the proper linkages between these resources and describing their relationships becomes an essential activity in their curation and preservation. In this paper we describe initial efforts to create a semantic knowledge base allow- ing easier integration and linking of the body of heterogeneous astronomical resources which we call the Virtual Observatory (VO). The ultimate goal of this effort is the creation of a semantic layer over existing resources, allowing applications to cross bound- aries between archives. The proposed approach follows the current best practices in Semantic Computing and the architecture of the web, allowing the use of 
off-the-shelf technologies and providing a path for VO resources to become part of the global web of linked data.},

	Abstract = {The availability of vast quantities of data through electronic archives has transformed astronomi- cal research. It has also enabled the creation of new products, models and simulations, often from distributed input data and models, that are themselves made electronically available. These prod- ucts will only provide maximal long-term value to astronomers when accompanied by records of their provenance; that is, records of the data and processes used in the creation of such prod- ucts. We use the creation of image mosaics with the Montage grid-enabled mosaic engine to emphasize the necessity of provenance management and to understand the science requirements that higher-level products impose on provenance management technologies. We describe experi- ments with one technology, the "Provenance Aware Service Oriented Architecture" (PASOA), that stores provenance information at each step in the computation of a mosaic. The results inform the technical specifications of provenance management systems, 
including the need for extensible systems built on common standards. Finally, we describe examples of provenance management technology emerging from the fields of geophysics and oceanography that have applicability to astronomy applications},

However, despite the early success in creating links across projects and data centers, the promise of a single integrated digital library environ- ment supporting e-science in astronomy has proven elusive. While some of the issues hampering progress in this area are of technical nature, others are rooted in existing policies which should be re-analyzed if further rapid progress is to be made in this area. This paper describes a pro- posal that the NASA Astrophysics Data System project has put forth in order to improve its role as one of the primary discovery portals for astronomers, focusing on those aspects which could benefit from an increased level of involvement from the community, namely the effort to expose astronomy resources as linked data, and the harvesting of observational metadata.},

	Abstract = {ESO Reflex is a prototype graphical workflow system, based on Taverna, and primarily intended to be a flexible way of running ESO data reduc- tion recipes along with other legacy applications and user-written tools. ESO Reflex can also readily use the Taverna Web Services features that are based on the Apache Axis SOAP implementation. Taverna is a general purpose Web Service client, and requires no programming to use such services. However, Tav- erna also has some restrictions: for example, no numerical types such integers. In addition the preferred binding style is document/literal wrapped, but most astronomical services publish the Axis default WSDL using RPC/encoded style. Despite these minor limitations we have created simple but very promising test VO workflow using the Sesame name resolver service at CDS Strasbourg, the Hubble SIAP server at the Multi-Mission Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) and the WESIX image cataloging and catalogue cross-referencing service at the University of 
Pittsburgh. ESO Reflex can also pass files and URIs via the PLAS- TIC protocol to visualisation tools and has its own viewer for VOTables. We picked these three Web Services to try to set up a realistic and useful ESO Reflex workflow. They also demonstrate ESO Reflex abilities to use many kind of Web Services because each of them requires a different interface. We describe each of these services in turn and comment on how it was used.},

	Abstract = {After a short introduction to workflow systems, we focus on the use of ''Characterization'', an IVOA standard, in a workflow test bed architecture. The execution of a workflow may require substantial computing resources and this can take a significant amount of time. Our goal is to go as far as possible in the validation of the workflow process before the ''real'' execution of its components. This validation needs a knowledge of the components and of the data they consume/produce. The ''Characterization'' standard introduces a way to satisfy these needs at the data level.},
